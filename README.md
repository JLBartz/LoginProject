This is a simple Python application that demonstrates a basic login interface using `tkinter`. It includes a username and password field, and displays a success or error message upon login attempt.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.0 or higher
Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional installations are necessary.

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tkinter-login-ui.git
   cd tkinter-login-ui
2. Run the script:
   python login_ui.py

Usage
When prompted, enter the username and password.

Default credentials:

Username: admin
Password: password

A success or failure message will pop up depending on your input.
